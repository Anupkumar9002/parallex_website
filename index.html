                    <p class="text">While the definition of adventure can vary from person to person, in broader context “risk taken when its outcome is unknown” can be termed as adventure. It is something that challenges you, it is something that lets you escape from your ordinary lives & thus it is something that changes you. It can make you feel more live & refreshed. Adventures can be sought in numerous ways such as mountaineering, river rafting, trekking, skydiving, scuba diving, etc. Even exploring new people & cities can be considered as an adventure.
                    <br> <br>
                    Adventure in many ways has been proven beneficial for us. Surmounting a challenge during an adventure is a brilliant way to leave us feeling positive about ourselves & thus has a positive impact on our mental health. Adventure & exploration can also really help us expand our horizons about nature, culture & more. Sometimes, it can also help us have a deeper insight about ourselves. This happens when we let ourselves loose in an unfamiliar situation. It can let our hidden strengths unveil and make us push our limits.

                    <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
                </div>

                
                    <p class="text"> Riding a bike, learning to swing or learning a new language can all be extremely difficult. One of my scariest experiences was learning how to ride a dirt bike at a young age. I was terrified of this little bike but, I’m glad I concurred it. I was always afraid of falling off the bike because I knew the fall would hurt badly. I felt that riding a dirt bike was an important skill I should learn. At the time, I thought it was only cool because I would get to ride and race my friends to the park and be like all the dudes on TV. I didn’t realize that once you learn to ride, you never really lose the touch as you get older. <br> <br>

                    biking will relieve stress.  Modern American life moves at the speed of light and with our busy schedules it’s easy to become over stressed.  Mental stress adversely affects our emotional and physical wellbeing.  According to the Mayo Clinic, stress that’s left unchecked can contribute to heart disease, obesity, and diabetes (Stress).  Regular exercise has been proven to relieve stress and will often reverse the symptoms of the diseases associated with it.

                    <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
                </div>

           
                    <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                    <br> <br>
                    Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

                    <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found as standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                    <br> <br>
                    The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
